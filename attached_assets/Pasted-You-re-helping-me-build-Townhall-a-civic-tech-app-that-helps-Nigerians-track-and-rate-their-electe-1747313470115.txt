You're helping me build Townhall — a civic tech app that helps Nigerians track and rate their elected officials.

I'm building solo, handling design and code, and I want you to help scaffold and implement the app based on what I’ve built so far.

🧠 Goal:
To test if Nigerians will engage with a fast, transparent, anonymous tool to hold elected officials accountable, by letting them:

Rate officials by performance (overall & sectoral)

Track sentiment over time

Search and view basic info on who represents them

📦 What I have:
React frontend (use standard React)

UI screens (I'll upload them)

A Supabase DB already seeded with:

Senators

House of Representatives

(Will add Governors, LGAs, etc. later)

Each leader already has:

name, office, constituency, state, party, term, start_year, gender, career_history, education_history

✅ MVP Features:
Authentication

Anonymous login only (via Supabase)

No email/password

Use device fingerprinting + IP for lightweight integrity

Rate Officials

One modal, two steps:

Step 1: Overall sentiment: 👍🏽 Positive / 😐 Neutral / 👎🏽 Negative

Step 2: Rate by sectors (unique per office)
e.g. Senators get: Lawmaking, Oversight, Constituency Projects
Governors get: Education, Security, Infrastructure, Economy, Health, etc.

Store each rating tied to:

Leader ID

Timestamp

Device/user fingerprint

View Public Sentiment

Show aggregated ratings over time

Show breakdown by sector

Display weekly/monthly change indicators

Leader Profile

Display:

Name, Office, State/Constituency, Party, Gender, Term (e.g. First Term)

Career History

Education History

Sentiment breakdown below

Search + Location Lookup

“Who represents me?”: User inputs state or LGA, gets their officials

🧰 Tech Stack:
Frontend: React

State Management: Zustand

Data Fetching: React Query

Backend: Supabase

Database: Supabase Postgres

Use the following credentials:

Supabase URL: https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co

Supabase anon key: your-anon-key-goes-here

🧩 Not in MVP (but plan to add later):
Petitions and leader responses

Profile view & rating history

Full NIN/BVN verification

Email/password login

Career validation via public data

🧭 Flow:
Anonymous onboarding

User searches leaders or enters location

Views a leader’s profile

Taps “Rate”

Modal step 1: Overall sentiment

Modal step 2: Rate by sector

Rating saved, sentiment updates

User can explore other profiles or return later

💡 What I want from you:
Scaffold the project with React, Zustand, React Query

Connect Supabase (auth + DB)

Create the 2-step rating modal

Pull data from DB (including education/career history)

Create profile, sentiment chart components

Add caching via React Query

Allow future modular feature additions
